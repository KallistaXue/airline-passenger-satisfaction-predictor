# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction_Applied-Machine-Learning-Project
Final Project for course COMS 4995 Applied Machine Learning
## COMS-W4995 Applied Machine Learning Project
The project assignment gives students an opportunity to apply different aspects of Machine Learning covered in the classroom to a real-world application. Through this project, students will get hands-on experience solving a Machine Learning problem including data analysis, visualization and applying machine learning models to develop actionable insights. The project will have three deliverables that are required to be submitted by the team throughout the course term. The students are randomly assigned to groups sized 4-6 and would be allowed one submission per group. 

## Airline Passenger Satisfaction 
### Background 
Air travel is an essential mode of transportation for many people, but the quality of the experience can vary greatly. Airlines often conduct passenger satisfaction surveys to better understand passenger satisfaction and identify key factors that influence it. The Airline Passenger Satisfaction classification problem seeks to analyze data from one such survey to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied based on these factors. By analyzing the data and identifying which factors are highly correlated with passenger satisfaction, airlines can make informed decisions about improving the passenger experience and, ultimately, improving overall performance and profitability.

### Objective
Predicting customer satisfaction considering 22 features using various ML techniques.
